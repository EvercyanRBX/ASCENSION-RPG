# ASCENSION RPG
Ascension RPG is an RPG I created in 2017, where my goal was to try a new project that included a couple new mechanics to my games, like Mana &amp; Magic weapons. as well as an advancements menu. Now open-source for the Roblox OSS & Classic RPG community.

This repository contains the latest version of the game under The Sparkle Time Studio, version 116 (published August 7, 2021).
